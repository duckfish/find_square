# Find Square

The web application with RANSAC-based algorithm for finding square shape.

## About

The web application is designed to showcase the effectiveness of the RANSAC algorithm in identifying shapes with indistinct or unclear boundaries. The platform serves as a tool to test and evaluate the robustness and accuracy of the RANSAC-based detection system, particularly in scenarios where shape detection might be challenging. E.g. shape crossed by lines. 

The efficiency and precision of the detection process are dependent on several factors, including the number of RANSAC iterations and the complexity of the input image.
