# Find Square

The web application with RANSAC-based algorithm and SquareNet CNN for finding square shape.

## About

This web application evaluates the performance of the RANSAC-based algorithm and SquareNet CNN in accurately identifying shapes with unclear or partially defined edges. Users can choose between the detectors to compare their accuracy and efficiency.
Please note that the quality of detection and processing time may vary depending on factors such as the number of RANSAC iterations, complexity of the image and the capabilities of the SquareNet CNN.
Both the RANSAC-based algorithm and SquareNet were designed from scratch.
